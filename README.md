# Telco Customer Churn Prediction 
Telco is a technology service provider for phone, internet, and streaming services. The companyâ€™s dataset
provides information about customers, the services they have signed up for, and payment details. The goal
of this project is to use the data to predict which customers are likely to churn, or leave the service. This
analysis will help the company further understand why certain customers are leaving and potentially prevent
customers from leaving. This dataset was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telcocustomer-churn). 
We start by performing exploratory data analysis to understand basic properties of the dataset. Then, we
prepare the data for modeling by splitting into training and test sets. We apply logistic regression, decision tree, 
and random forest algorithms to make predictions on customers most likely to churn. Finally, we evaluate the results
of these three approaches and select the most appropriate model.
